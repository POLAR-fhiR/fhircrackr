\title{Next Bundle's URL}
\usage{
fhir_next_bundle_url(bundle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bundle}{The bundle from which you wish to extract the next link. If this is \code{NULL} (the default), the function will
extract the next link from the last bundle that was downloaded in the most recent call to \code{\link[=fhir_search]{fhir_search()}}.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{fhir_url} object referencing next bundle available on the FHIR server.
Empty \linkS4class{fhir_url} / character vector, if no further bundle is available.
}
\description{
fhir_next_bundle_url() gives the link to the next available bundle, either of the bundle
you provided in the argument \code{bundle} or of the last call to \code{\link[=fhir_search]{fhir_search()}}, if \code{bundle=NULL} (the default).

This function is useful when you don't have a lot of memory available or when a download of bundles was
interrupted for some reason. In case of small memory, you can use \code{fhir_next_bundle_url} together with the
\code{max_bundle} argument from \code{\link[=fhir_search]{fhir_search()}} to download bundles in smaller batches in a loop.
See details in the example.
